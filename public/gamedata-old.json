It says: Opaque, pale cakes of fermented lard, 40 gallon drum of butter posted up in my yard. Smelling like oil for the rest of my life, air's so dank hard to cut with a knife.  Chubby rain, vacuoles of pain stifling my brain. Ludicrous lipid levels compressing my lid, rendering down fat from a P.I.G. pig.  Hot skulls baking in the summer heat; basted onion heads filled with day old bread.  Glazed doughnut & a bottle of anything,  lipid rivers in the sewer lead to Wendy's and Burger King. Hey Alopecia, nice ta meet ya. I take a ride to the hairpiece store, Can't flip my wig proper no more. Hollow-tipped biological slugs hopping in a vat of beer, rest in piece to a shelled bug.  Mayonnaise on my mind, oil on my bread, Cold cut hypnosis, olive loaf's starting to own me. Now I'm feeling lonely without fried bologna.          -RH",

In fact you feel you like you could stay here forever, sipping on this delicious gin and tonic. Surrounded by people who know your name...",

If only you could have found some delicious ice cold gin! You feel more sober than ever. Looking at Sam Malone, you remember that he's not even real. He's a fictional character played by Ted Danson who you're pretty sure is not here right now. In fact it occurs to you that nobody is here right now, and \"here\" isn't really anywhere. You look behind you and see only a void. The Abbey is fading away before your eyes. You feel cold. You remember that The Abbey is gone forever, and realize that the only piece of it left is what lives on in your memory. You're starting to feel sick looking at this fading simulacrum. Ugly though it may be, you'd be better off in the real world, living with your memories of good times. It's time to stop playing this game and face reality.",
